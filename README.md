Tutorial repository to git gud @ gitHub

My name is Marcelo Escamilla, I am a systems engineering student. Im a bit frustrated with myself since I feel that I haven't achieved big things. So I wanna git gud @ programming, networking, cyber-security, etc. to show myself I can learn and do big things.
